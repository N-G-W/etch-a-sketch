//create grids that are apparently divs
//these grids will access the container div and add
// grids to that
//using flexbox to create grids
//setting up a hover effect so grid divs change color
// when mouse passes over them leaving a pixelated trail
//through the grid like a pen
// allow a button to ask the number of sides of new grid

// 1. create a function called createBlock
// This function should:
// a)Take in as an input a number that defines
// the number of sides of the sketchpad
// b)It should also create the divs elements/nodes
// c)It should append those nodes to the div container
// d)Use the hover event on the div to change the color
// of the divs
// e)Add button that asks the number of side for new grid

// Key challenges:
// How to create a grid using flexbox
// How to change the color of the div
